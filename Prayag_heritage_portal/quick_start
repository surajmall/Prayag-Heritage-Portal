$ mkdir original_prayag                  // make a different dir for original project

$ cd original_prayag      

$ git init 

$ git remote add https://github.com/dbads/prayag_heritage_portal.git 

$ git pull origin master      

__provide username and password

$ git branch yourname_(backend/frontend)    // this will make a seperate branch for you with all content in master

$ git checkout yourname_(backend/frontend)   // this will bring you in your own branch

$ Now you are in your seperate branch, do your dirty tasks here, and then merge them with master by following way

$ don't forget to activate your virtual environment.. Download all requirements using # pip install pack_name

$ Runserver and complete your tasks :::))))

$ git rebase master                     // This will update you with master(main) branch

$ git push origin your_branch_name      // this will push the work from your local branch to your central branch

$ git checkout master                 // switching to master branch

$ git rebase your_branch_name          // adding your changes to local master branch

$ now don't push it on origin master, just edit your readme, and tell that you want to push in central master repo, dbads will merge them

$$ congrats You did it well !!!
